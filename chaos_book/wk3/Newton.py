# We can now construct the return map over arclengths, we have already

# zero at the fixed points of the return map:

#We now have a candidate arclength that should be near to that of a fixed point
#of the return map, and fixed point of the return map must be a periodic orbit
#of the full flow!
#In order to find the state space point corresponding to this arc length, first
#we should find it on the Poincare section, luckily, we already have a function
#for that:
PoincareSectionfixed = fPoincare(sfixed)
#We then back-project from the Poincare section into the full state space
#using our Projection matrix:
sspfixed = dot(append(PoincareSectionfixed, 0.0), ProjPoincare)
#Note that we appended a 0 to the end of the PoincareSectionfixed vector
#in order to be able to multiply it with the projection matrix. This zero
#corresponds to the direction which is perpendicular to the Poincare
#section

#We will now find how much time does it takes for a trajectory which starts
#at this point to intersect the Poincare section for a second time, to do
#that we update our lambda function fdeltat for sspfixed:
fdeltat = lambda deltat: poincare.UPoincare(Flow(sspfixed, deltat))
#In order to solve for this time, we need an initial guess. We guess it by
#dividing the total integration time of our simulation by the number of
#intersections with the Poincare section:
Tguess = tFinal / size(PoincareSection, 0)
Tnext = fsolve(fdeltat, Tguess)[0]  # Note that we pick the 0th element of the
                                    # array returned by fsolve, this is because
                                    # fsolve returns a numpy array even if the
                                    # problem is one dimensional

#Time array for solution from 0 to Tnext:
tArray = linspace(0, Tnext, 100)
#Integration:

#Lastly, we are going to refine our guesses to find the periodic orbit
