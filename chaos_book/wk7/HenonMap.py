        Try to obtain the stable and unstable manifold for
        equilibrium '0' in Henon map with parameter a=6, b=-1.

        Plotting unstable/stable manifold is a difficult task in general.
        We need to moniter a lot of variables, like the distances between points
        along the manifold, the angle formed by adjacent 3 points on the manifold, etc.
        However, for Henon map, a simple algorithm is enough for demonstration purpose.
        The algorithm works as follows:

        Unstable manifold: start from a point close to equilibrium '0', in the direction of
        the expanding eigenvector: ' eq0 + r0 * V_e '. Here 'eq0' is the equilibrium,
        'r0' is a small number, 'V_e' is the expanding eigen direction of equilibrium '0'.
        The image of
        this point after one forward iteration should be very close to
        ' eq0 + r0 * \Lambda_e * V_e', where
        '\Lambda_e' is the expanding multiplier. We can confidently think that these two
        points are sitting on the unstable manifold of 'eq0' since 'r0' is very small.
        Now, we interpolate linearly between these two points and get total 'N' points.
        If we iterate these 'N' points forward for 'NumOfIter' times, we get the unstable
        manifold within some length.
        The crutial part of this method is that when these 'N' state points are being iterated,
        the spacings between them get larger and larger, so we need to use a relative large
        value 'N' to ensure that these state points are not too far away from each other.
        The following formula is used to determine 'N' ( please figure out its meaning
        and convince yourself ):

        ( (\Lambda_e - 1) * r0 / N ) * (\Lambda_e)^NumOfIter = tol  (*)

        Here, 'tol' is the tolerance distance between adjacent points in the unstable manifold.

        Stable manifold: If we reverse the dynamics, then the stable direction becomes the
        ustable direction, so we can use the same method as above to obtain stable manifold.
